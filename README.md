# Juke Box Mania

## Objectives

+ Effectively use anonymous functions

## Intro

You've been hired to work for an online Juke Box company. Your job is to clean up their messy code and to replace any defined functions that are only used once with an anonymous function. Remember where you most commonly see anonymous functions, and replace carefully!

## Instructions

You will be coding your solution in `js/jukebox.js`. You'll want to make sure that things work in both the browser and the tests. The tests currently all pass. You'll want to make sure they continue to pass once you're done refactoring.
